# Final Project Update

***Explain progress made since your initial pitch***
Since my initial pitch, I have used Tabula to extract all of the data I need from each annual 'Crime in California' report from 2000 to 2020. I extracted six different tables from each report. The tables are comparable year over year. See the README file for this project for me details on how the .csv files from the extraction are organized. 

***Explain your next steps to complete this project***
- I need to clean the data I've extracted from the annual crime reports.
- I need to use the census API that we discussed to pull the state population data from that twenty year period, as we discussed.
- Finally, I need to graph my data!

***Detail problems and obstacles, and help you need from me at our next individual meeting***
At our last meeting, we left it that we would together write out an R script that would allow me to clean my csv files that I extracted from the annual report. That's the main piece of help I need at this stage.

Cleaning the data may be a bit tricky. For example, during the extraction, some of the columns were merged together into a single cell, so we'll likely need to run an operation dividing the data on a space. There is also an error in the first column for all four tables of 2000 data.

Looking forward to hearing you feedback on the work I've done thus far.
