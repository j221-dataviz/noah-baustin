# noah-baustin-final-project

***Project goal:***
The primary goal of this project is to analyze how marijuana arrests in California have changed over the past twenty years. Running from 2000 through 2020.

***Data sources:***
The arrest data in this project comes from the California Department of Justice. It draws from an annual report the department publishes called 'Crime in California.' All of those reports are published on the California DOJ website [here](https://oag.ca.gov/cjsc/pubs#crime).

This project will also utilize population data published by the US Census. Here is a US Census dataset covering state population demographics [2010-2019](https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-state-detail.html). Here are the state [intercensal datasets](https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/popest/intercensal-2000-2010-state.html) for 2000-2010 from the US Census.

***Questions this project will address:***
- What was the per capita number of marijuana felony and misdemeanor arrests in California from 2000 through 2020?
- What portion of the total drug crime arrests were marijuana crimes from 2000 through 2020?
- How have the age demographics of who was arrested for marijuana crimes changed over time 2000 to 2020?

***Data Key***
The data for this project is saved in the 'data' folder. The arrest data is stored in the 'csv_exports' folder. Each subfolder contains a series of csv's. Each csv draws from the same table, pulled from a different annual 'Crime in California' report.
